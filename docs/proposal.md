# Sunbird AI Assistant Proposal

## Summary

I propose to develop a sophisticated AI assistant for Sunbird Ed that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide contextual, personalized learning support. My vision is to create a multi-agent system that goes beyond basic chatbot functionality to deliver truly intelligent educational assistance.

Rather than implementing a single monolithic AI assistant, I'll develop a network of specialized agents working in concert, each focusing on different aspects of the educational experience: resource navigation, learning path optimization, engagement adaptation, and cultural-linguistic customization. This approach will enable deeper personalization while maintaining efficient resource usage.

The assistant will progressively build understanding of users' learning patterns through a dynamic knowledge graph, employing Bayesian intent classification to optimize API usage and provide explainable recommendations. The system will adapt to users' knowledge levels and regional contexts, with graceful degradation for environments with limited connectivity or resources.

## Project Detail

### Project Overview

#### Understanding of the project

The Sunbird Ed platform currently lacks an AI-powered assistant that can interact contextually with its APIs, tailored to installation or individual user needs. The core requirements include:

1. Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect to Sunbird Ed APIs
2. Definition of tool schemas for course metadata, user enrollments, and progress data retrieval
3. Development of a lightweight interface for querying the AI assistant
4. Implementation of installation-specific context injection into MCP sessions
5. Support for personalized learning through contextual understanding

The assistant must first respond based on installation-level context before extending to user-level personalization, ensuring relevant and helpful interactions within the educational ecosystem.

#### Issues that might come up and the support needed from the org

1. **API Access and Documentation**
   - Need comprehensive documentation for all Sunbird Ed APIs
   - Require test environment access for development and testing
   - Support for understanding data schemas and authentication mechanisms

2. **Performance Constraints**
   - MCP integration might introduce latency; need API performance metrics
   - Resource-constrained environments might struggle with full functionality
   - Need guidelines on expected response times and resource limitations

3. **Context Standardization**
   - Installation-specific contexts may vary widely; need standardization guidelines
   - Will need examples of typical installation configurations
   - Support for determining essential vs. optional context parameters

4. **Data Privacy and Security**
   - Need clear guidelines on data handling and retention policies
   - Support for implementing appropriate security measures
   - Guidelines on user consent management for AI interactions

#### Solutions

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**
   - Implement specialized agents for different educational functions
   - Use a meta-agent to orchestrate responses and maintain conversation coherence
   - Ensure modular design for easier maintenance and extension

2. **Efficient Resource Management**
   - Implement predictive caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use Bloom filters to minimize unnecessary API calls
   - Develop hierarchical caching with adaptive policies
   - Create lightweight fallback modes for low-connectivity environments

3. **Contextual Understanding**
   - Build dynamic knowledge graphs of user-content interactions
   - Employ vector embeddings with time-decay for efficient context processing
   - Implement cultural and linguistic adaptations for different regions
   - Use Bayesian intent classification for optimal API usage

4. **Implementation Approach**
   - Develop as a microservice that integrates with Sunbird
   - Implement circuit breakers for API resilience
   - Support offline functionality for essential features
   - Use webhook-based updates for real-time context changes
